# Site Overview
This document would describe the site's content. This includes the pages, posts, and plugins used for the website.

## Pages
These are static pages that make the backbone of our website. However, they do not have the dynamic content, which will be shown in the `"Posts"` section.

### Home
This is the default landing page of our website, where we introduce the user to what Baizonn Learning Centre has to offer. The first impression is important since they will more likely stay in our website.<br><br>
Here is the list of what to expect from the Home Page:
- A welcome slider within the template (use a plugin for that, like Smart Slider 3) or a set of pictures to welcome new users into the website.
- In each slide of the slider or picture, add links (buttons) to other pages like the registration, contact form, and blogs of other events.
- Mention the history of Baizonn, alongside what they provide.
- Mention the two acronyms of F.A.S.T and S.T.E.M.
