# Deployment Overview

The name of the website that we are making is `Baizonn Learning Center`. We need to create the website while making use of WordPress. This document would describe the hosting and deployment, followed by the environment that we used, and the workflow of the development.

## Project Management
To manage the project itself, we made use of Discord, Trello, and a Word document for weekly standups to facilitate discussions and be aware of what needs to be done to get the project done with.

Here are the links to those parts of the project management below:

## Hosting and Deployment

For the hosting, we decided to run with SiteGround for our hosting since it allows us to download WordPress and make use of the staging feature to test out features that we want to add without affecting the life site.

As for who would be the one hosting the site, Dean Alexander Santos Buno has published the links to the production/live site and the testing site below:
- Production site: <a href="https://baizonnlearningctr.com/">https://baizonnlearningctr.com/</a>
- Staging site: <a href="https://staging2.baizonnlearningctr.com/wp-admin">https://staging2.baizonnlearningctr.com/wp-admin</a>

## Environment

The environment that we are using is the same as where we are hosting the site, which is SiteGround.
